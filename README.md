# Rpl

Rpl is a Ruby based propositional logic library. Propositional logic is a simple but powerful
knowledge representation language. Propositional logic sentences are stored in a knowledge base
and represent some assertion about the world. Once the knowledge base has sufficient information
about the world it can be queried. The knowledge base will then use one of a number of inference
algorithms to produce an answer to the query.

# Install

```shell
gem install rpl

```

or add the following line to your Gemfile

```
gem 'rpl'
```
